--- I want you to act like Cloud AWS DevOps Engineer. You have a infrastucture: 1 ec2 instance with 1 unattached, non-encrypted disk with tag {"Name": "non-attached"}, 1 attached, non-encrypted disk with tag {"Name": "non-encrypted-1"},  1 attached, non-encrypted disk with tag {"Name": "non-encrypted-2"} and 3 non-encrypted snapshots of these disks. You have to create lambda function with Python code that collects the metrics from the number and overall size of unattached disk volumes, not encrypted disk volumes, and not encrypted snapshots.

--- To create a Lambda function in Python that collects the metrics from the number and overall size of unattached disk volumes, non-encrypted disk volumes, and non-encrypted snapshots, you can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Setup Your AWS Environment
AWS CLI: Ensure you have AWS CLI installed and configured with necessary access rights.

AWS SDK: Install AWS SDK (boto3) for Python. You can add it to your Lambda function later in the deployment package.

IAM Role: Create an IAM Role with permissions to access EC2 and CloudWatch (to publish metrics) and assign this role to your Lambda function.

Step 2: Create Your Lambda Function
You will need to create a Lambda function using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI. Here's how you can do it using the console:

Go to the AWS Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new Lambda function and choose "Author from scratch".
Configure the function with a name, runtime (Python 3.8 or later), and the IAM role created in step 1.
In the function code section, you can use the following Python script as a starting point:
python
Copy code
import boto3

# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Initialize the response dictionary
    response = {
        "unattached_volumes": {
            "count": 0,
            "size": 0
        },
        "non_encrypted_volumes": {
            "count": 0,
            "size": 0
        },
        "non_encrypted_snapshots": {
            "count": 0
        }
    }

    # Get details of all volumes
    volumes = ec2.describe_volumes()['Volumes']
    
    # Loop through all volumes to count unattached and non-encrypted volumes
    for volume in volumes:
        if volume['State'] == 'available':
            response["unattached_volumes"]["count"] += 1
            response["unattached_volumes"]["size"] += volume['Size']
        
        if volume['Encrypted'] == False:
            response["non_encrypted_volumes"]["count"] += 1
            response["non_encrypted_volumes"]["size"] += volume['Size']

    # Get details of all snapshots
    snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
    
    # Loop through all snapshots to count non-encrypted snapshots
    for snapshot in snapshots:
        if snapshot['Encrypted'] == False:
            response["non_encrypted_snapshots"]["count"] += 1

    return response

# You might want to print or log the response dictionary to view the output
Step 3: Test Your Lambda Function
Create a test event and execute your Lambda function to see if it's working as expected. You should see the metrics in the output.

Step 4: Publish Metrics to CloudWatch (Optional)
To publish these metrics to CloudWatch, you can modify the script to use boto3's CloudWatch client and publish custom metrics using the put_metric_data method.

Step 5: Deployment
Deploy the function and configure a trigger if needed. You might want to schedule this Lambda function to run periodically using Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

--- elaborate on how to create proper IAM Role

--- Creating an IAM role with the necessary permissions for the Lambda function involves a few steps. Here’s a detailed guide:

Step 1: Open IAM in AWS Management Console
Navigate to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM (Identity and Access Management) service.
In the navigation pane, choose "Roles" and then click "Create role".
Step 2: Choose AWS Service Role
In the "AWS service" section, select "Lambda" to grant permissions that the Lambda function will have.
Click "Next: Permissions" to proceed.
Step 3: Attach Permissions Policies
Attach policies that grant your Lambda function permissions to access EC2 and CloudWatch resources. You would at least need the following permissions:

EC2:DescribeVolumes - To get details about EC2 volumes.
EC2:DescribeSnapshots - To get details about EC2 snapshots.
CloudWatch:PutMetricData - To publish custom metrics to CloudWatch (if needed).
You can create a custom policy with the above permissions. Here's a JSON representation of such a policy:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
        }
    ]
}
Click on "Create policy", switch to the JSON tab, and paste the above JSON. Then review and create the policy.
Back in the "Create role" page, attach the newly created policy to the role.
Click "Next: Tags" to proceed (adding tags is optional).
Click "Next: Review".
Step 4: Review and Create the Role
Name your role appropriately, so it’s descriptive of its function (e.g., Lambda_EC2_Metrics_Role).
Optionally, provide a description for the role.
Review the permissions and policies attached to the role to ensure everything is set up as required.
Click "Create role" to create the role.
Step 5: Attach the Role to Lambda Function
Go to the Lambda function that you created.
In the "Configuration" tab, navigate to "Execution role".
Select "Use an existing role" and choose the role that you just created from the drop-down list.
Now your Lambda function should have the necessary permissions to execute the tasks as outlined in your script. Remember to test the function thoroughly to ensure that the role and permissions are correctly configured.

Note:
Remember to adhere to the principle of least privilege (PoLP) when assigning permissions to ensure the security of your AWS environment. It means granting only the permissions necessary to perform a task, which helps to minimize potential damage in the case of an accidental or deliberate breach.

--- The output from this function has to be saved on S3 bucket in json format.  Storage has to be encrypted, lifecycle policies, and access control are configured.

--- To achieve this, you will have to make some modifications to your Lambda function and setup configurations in your S3 bucket. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Update IAM Role
Update the IAM role to include permissions for writing files to an S3 bucket and applying encryption. You would add the following permissions to the custom policy:

json
Copy code
"s3:PutObject",
"s3:PutObjectAcl",
"s3:PutObjectTagging"
The updated policy might look like this:

json
Copy code
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        ...,
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
        }
    ]
}
Step 2: Configure Your S3 Bucket
Encryption
Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
Create a new bucket or select an existing bucket.
In the bucket properties, enable default encryption (you can choose either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS as per your requirement).
Lifecycle Policies
In the bucket management tab, navigate to "Lifecycle".
Create a new lifecycle rule where you can define transitions to other storage classes or configure object expiration.
Access Control
In the bucket permissions tab, you can configure bucket policies, CORS, and ACL according to your requirements to control the access to the bucket and objects in it.
Step 3: Update Lambda Function to Save Output to S3
Modify your Lambda function to save the output to the S3 bucket in JSON format. You can use the boto3 S3 client to put the object in the S3 bucket. Here’s how the updated Lambda handler might look:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # ... (rest of your existing code)

    # Convert the response dictionary to JSON format
    response_json = json.dumps(response)

    # Save the JSON data to S3
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket='your-bucket-name',
        Key='metrics_output.json',
        Body=response_json,
        ServerSideEncryption='AES256'  # This applies server-side encryption to the object
    )

    return response
Step 4: Test Your Lambda Function
After updating the IAM role and Lambda function, test the function to ensure the output is correctly saved to the S3 bucket in JSON format.

Step 5: Error Handling
Implement error handling in your Lambda function to gracefully handle potential issues, such as permissions errors or issues with writing data to S3.

With this setup, your Lambda function should be able to gather the required metrics and save the output to an encrypted S3 bucket with configured lifecycle policies and access control. Make sure to replace 'your-bucket-name' with the actual name of your S3 bucket and to thoroughly test the setup to ensure it's functioning correctly.

--- Bucket name is viktoriia-lambda-output-bucket. Make lambda to be run once a day and rewrite function with avoiding hardcode values.

--- To set up your Lambda function to run once a day and avoid hardcoded values, you can make use of environment variables for configurable values and set up an Amazon EventBridge (formerly CloudWatch Events) rule to trigger the function daily. Here’s how you can do it:

Step 1: Modify Your Lambda Function to Use Environment Variables
You can use environment variables to avoid hardcoding the S3 bucket name and other configurable values in your script. Modify the script to retrieve the bucket name from environment variables like this:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json
import os

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # ... (rest of your existing code)

    # Get the bucket name from environment variables
    bucket_name = os.environ['BUCKET_NAME']
    
    # Convert the response dictionary to JSON format
    response_json = json.dumps(response)

    # Save the JSON data to S3
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        Key='metrics_output.json',
        Body=response_json,
        ServerSideEncryption='AES256'  # This applies server-side encryption to the object
    )

    return response
Step 2: Configure Environment Variables in Lambda
Navigate to your Lambda function in the AWS Lambda console.
In the "Configuration" tab, find the "Environment variables" section.
Add a new environment variable with the key BUCKET_NAME and the value viktoriia-lambda-output-bucket.
Step 3: Modify IAM Role to Include EventBridge Permissions
Update the IAM role to include permissions to be invoked by Amazon EventBridge:

json
Copy code
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "events:PutEvents"
    ],
    "Resource": "*"
}
Step 4: Set Up an Amazon EventBridge Rule
Go to the Amazon EventBridge console.
Create a new rule.
In the "Event Source" section, choose "Schedule".
Set up a schedule using a cron expression or rate expression to run once a day. A rate expression for once a day would be: rate(1 day).
In the "Targets" section, add your Lambda function as a target.
Configure other settings as necessary, and create the rule.
Now your Lambda function should be configured to run once a day and store the output in the specified S3 bucket without hardcoded values. The bucket name is configured through an environment variable, and the function is triggered daily by an EventBridge rule.

Test your setup to ensure that the Lambda function is executed as expected and the metrics are correctly stored in the S3 bucket.

--- show full lambda code

--- Absolutely, here is the modified Lambda function which uses an environment variable to specify the bucket name, and can be triggered daily by an EventBridge rule:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json
import os

# Initialize a session using Amazon EC2
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # Initialize the response dictionary
    response = {
        "unattached_volumes": {
            "count": 0,
            "size": 0
        },
        "non_encrypted_volumes": {
            "count": 0,
            "size": 0
        },
        "non_encrypted_snapshots": {
            "count": 0
        }
    }

    # Get details of all volumes
    volumes = ec2.describe_volumes()['Volumes']
    
    # Loop through all volumes to count unattached and non-encrypted volumes
    for volume in volumes:
        if volume['State'] == 'available':
            response["unattached_volumes"]["count"] += 1
            response["unattached_volumes"]["size"] += volume['Size']
        
        if volume['Encrypted'] == False:
            response["non_encrypted_volumes"]["count"] += 1
            response["non_encrypted_volumes"]["size"] += volume['Size']

    # Get details of all snapshots
    snapshots = ec2.describe_snapshots(OwnerIds=['self'])['Snapshots']
    
    # Loop through all snapshots to count non-encrypted snapshots
    for snapshot in snapshots:
        if snapshot['Encrypted'] == False:
            response["non_encrypted_snapshots"]["count"] += 1

    # Get the bucket name from environment variables
    bucket_name = os.environ['BUCKET_NAME']
    
    # Convert the response dictionary to JSON format
    response_json = json.dumps(response)

    # Save the JSON data to S3
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket=bucket_name,
        Key='metrics_output.json',
        Body=response_json,
        ServerSideEncryption='AES256'  # This applies server-side encryption to the object
    )

    return response
In this script:

We initiate clients for EC2 and S3 services at the start.
The function lambda_handler is defined to handle the execution of the Lambda function.
We query the EC2 service for volumes and snapshots information and compute the metrics based on the specified criteria (unattached volumes, non-encrypted volumes, and non-encrypted snapshots).
We use the os module to fetch the bucket name from the environment variables (BUCKET_NAME).
We convert the response dictionary to JSON format.
We then save the JSON data to the specified S3 bucket with server-side encryption enabled.
You would set the BUCKET_NAME environment variable to viktoriia-lambda-output-bucket in the Lambda function configuration in AWS Console. You should also set up an EventBridge rule to trigger this Lambda function once a day, as described in the previous steps.

--- Event Bridge has new EventBridge Scheduler how should I use it?

--- The EventBridge Scheduler is a part of AWS EventBridge that allows you to set up automated schedules to trigger various targets including Lambda functions, based on a cron or rate expression. It is essentially the evolution of CloudWatch Events and integrates tightly with a variety of AWS services.

To use the new EventBridge Scheduler to trigger your Lambda function once a day, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open EventBridge in AWS Management Console
Navigate to the AWS Management Console and open the EventBridge service.
Step 2: Create a New Rule
On the EventBridge home page, click on "Create rule".
In the "Name" field, enter a descriptive name for your rule.
Optionally, you can add a description to detail what this rule is for.
Step 3: Configure the Rule
In the "Define pattern" section, select "Event Source" as "EventBridge Scheduler".

Now, you have two options to define your schedule:

Rate expression: This is a simpler way to define schedules using a rate expression. To trigger the event once a day, you can use an expression like rate(1 day).

Cron expression: This allows you to define more complex schedules. For example, to run the function every day at 6 AM UTC, the expression would be 0 6 * * ? *.

Step 4: Set Up the Target
Scroll down to the "Select targets" section.
Click on "Add target".
In the "Target" dropdown, select "Lambda function".
In the "Function" dropdown, select your Lambda function (the one you want to run on the schedule).
Make sure "Create a new role for this specific resource" is selected, or choose an existing role that has permissions to invoke Lambda functions.
Step 5: Create the Rule
Review your settings to make sure everything is set up as desired.
Click on "Create rule" to create the rule and set up the schedule.
Your Lambda function will now be triggered once a day at the time specified in your cron or rate expression. Make sure to test the rule to ensure it triggers the Lambda function as expected.

That's it! You've set up your Lambda function to be triggered daily by the EventBridge Scheduler. You can always go back to modify the rule settings or cron/rate expression as needed.

--- elaborate on Step 4.5

--- Certainly, step 4.5 is about assigning the appropriate IAM role to your EventBridge rule so that it has the necessary permissions to invoke your Lambda function. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

4.5: IAM Role Assignment
Create a new role for this specific resource: If you select this option, AWS will automatically create a new IAM role with the necessary permissions to invoke the Lambda function. This is a convenient option because you don't have to create and manage the IAM role manually. AWS will set up the necessary trust policies and permissions for you.

Use existing role: If you have an existing IAM role that you want to use, you can select this option. Here's how you can go about it:

a. Creating a Role Manually (if not already created): Before you can select an existing role, you would need to have a role created with the necessary permissions. To create an IAM role manually:

Go to the IAM console in the AWS Management Console.
Choose "Roles" from the navigation pane and then "Create role".
Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity type and select "EventBridge" as the service that will assume this role.
Attach permissions policies that grant the necessary permissions. At a minimum, this policy should grant the lambda:InvokeFunction permission, which allows the role to invoke Lambda functions.
Review and create the role.
b. Selecting the Role: After creating the role, come back to the EventBridge rule setup:

In the "Existing role" option, select the IAM role that you have created from the drop-down list.
AWS will use this role to assume the necessary permissions to invoke your Lambda function when the rule is triggered.
By setting up the appropriate IAM role, you ensure that your EventBridge rule has the necessary permissions to invoke your Lambda function successfully. This is a critical step in the setup process to ensure the secure and proper functioning of your automated workflow.

I hope this clarifies step 4.5 for you! Let me know if you have any other questions.

--- The function should be tested and verified to collect the required metrics once a day using cloud SDK and all the necessary packages for function development into should be installed into the newly created venv using a requirements file. 

--- To create a functional setup where you can develop and test the Lambda function locally using a virtual environment (venv), you'll need to do the following:

Step 1: Setup Virtual Environment
Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder. Set up a virtual environment using:

sh
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
On Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
Step 2: Create a requirements.txt file
Create a file named requirements.txt in the project folder with the following content:

Copy code
boto3
This file lists all the Python packages required by your function. In your case, boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python, which is required to interact with AWS services.

Install the packages using:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Develop the Lambda Function
You already have the Lambda function code. Save it as a .py file (let's call it lambda_function.py) in the project folder.

Step 4: Test the Function Locally
To test the function locally, you can create another script (let's call it test.py) that imports the lambda_function module and calls the lambda_handler function. Create a test.py file in the project folder with the following content:

python
Copy code
import lambda_function

event = {}  # You can populate this with any event data you want to test with
context = {}  # This can be left as an empty dictionary for local testing

result = lambda_function.lambda_handler(event, context)
print(result)
Now, run the test script:

sh
Copy code
python test.py
This will execute the Lambda function locally and print the result to the console.

Step 5: Deploy the Function to AWS
Once you have verified that the function works locally, you can deploy it to AWS. To do this, you'll need to package the function and its dependencies in a zip file. Run the following commands in the terminal:

sh
Copy code
deactivate  # Exit the virtual environment
zip -r package.zip . -x "venv/*" "test.py"
This will create a zip file named package.zip containing your function and the boto3 package.

You can then upload package.zip to AWS Lambda via the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

Step 6: Setup EventBridge Rule
Follow the earlier steps to set up the EventBridge rule to trigger your Lambda function once a day.

Step 7: Monitoring and Logging
After deploying the function and setting up the EventBridge rule, you can monitor the function's execution and view logs in CloudWatch to ensure it's running correctly and gathering the required metrics.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have further questions!

--- how can i check that eventbridge rule is working as expected

--- To check if the EventBridge rule is working as expected, you can perform several checks including viewing logs in CloudWatch, manually triggering the rule, and checking the S3 bucket for expected outputs. Here’s a detailed walkthrough:

Step 1: AWS CloudWatch Logs
AWS Lambda integrates with CloudWatch Logs, where you can view the logs generated by your function.

Go to AWS CloudWatch: Open the AWS CloudWatch service in AWS Management Console.
Logs: In the navigation pane, click on "Logs".
Log Groups: Find the log group named after your Lambda function, it should be in a format similar to /aws/lambda/your_function_name.
View Logs: Inside the log group, you can check the logs for each function execution to see if it's being triggered by the EventBridge rule as expected.
Step 2: CloudWatch Metrics
Go to EventBridge: Open the EventBridge service in the AWS Management Console.
Rules: In the navigation pane, click on "Rules" and select your rule.
Monitoring Tab: Click on the "Monitoring" tab to view the CloudWatch metrics associated with this rule. You should be able to see metrics regarding the invocations of your rule.
Step 3: Manual Testing
Test Rule Execution: Go back to the EventBridge service and find your rule in the rules list.
Actions: Select your rule, and under "Actions", click "Put events" to manually trigger the rule. This will invoke the Lambda function immediately, regardless of the schedule defined in the rule.
Check Lambda Output: After manually triggering the rule, check your S3 bucket for the JSON output file to verify that the Lambda function is working correctly.
Step 4: Check S3 Bucket
Ensure that your Lambda function is writing the expected outputs to your S3 bucket:

Go to S3: Open the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
Bucket: Navigate to your bucket (viktoriia-lambda-output-bucket) and check if the metrics output file (metrics_output.json) is being created and updated daily.
Step 5: CloudTrail
If you want to investigate further, you can also check AWS CloudTrail for logs of the API calls made by EventBridge when invoking your Lambda function.

Go to CloudTrail: Open the CloudTrail service in the AWS Management Console.
Event History: In the navigation pane, click on "Event history".
Filter: You can filter the events by event source (e.g., events.amazonaws.com) to find the invocations of your Lambda function by EventBridge.
After performing these checks, you should have a clear picture of whether the EventBridge rule is working as expected. Let me know if you need more information on any of the steps.

--- elaborate on manual testing

--- Certainly! Performing manual tests of your EventBridge rule can help you verify that the rule and the Lambda function it triggers are configured correctly and working as expected. Here's how you can go about it step by step:

Step 1: Access the EventBridge Console
Go to your AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the "Amazon EventBridge" service.
Step 2: Locate Your Rule
In the left sidebar, click on "Rules".
Find your rule in the list and click on it to view its details.
Step 3: Manually Trigger the Rule
Within the rule details page, find and click on the "Actions" dropdown menu (usually located at the top right corner).
Select "Put events" from the dropdown menu. This option allows you to manually send events to your rule.
Step 4: Configure Test Event
A dialog will appear prompting you to configure the test event.
You might need to specify the event source and other details depending on your rule's configuration. Usually, for testing, you can leave the event details as default or fill them with sample data that matches the expected input format of your Lambda function.
Step 5: Send the Test Event
Click on the "Send" or "Put events" button to manually send the event.
This will trigger the Lambda function associated with the rule immediately, even if the scheduled time hasn't arrived.
Step 6: Verify Lambda Function Execution
Go to the AWS Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
Find and click on your Lambda function to view its details.
Click on the "Monitoring" tab to view the invocation metrics. You should see a spike in invocations corresponding to your manual test.
You can also check the "Logs" tab to view detailed logs of the function execution.
Step 7: Verify Output in S3 Bucket
After manually triggering the rule and executing the Lambda function, navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
Find your bucket (viktoriia-lambda-output-bucket) and verify that the expected output (JSON file with metrics) is present and contains the expected data.
This process will help you ensure that your EventBridge rule is correctly triggering your Lambda function and that the function is working as expected. If necessary, based on the output and logs, you can make adjustments to your rule or Lambda function configuration to correct any issues.

Let me know if you have any more questions or need further clarification!

--- I dont see any Actions in dropdown menu

--- I apologize for any confusion. You can manually trigger a rule via the AWS CLI or SDKs. To do this, you would use the put-events command. Here's how you can do it:

Step 1: Install and Configure AWS CLI
If you haven't already, install the AWS CLI and configure it with your AWS credentials using the aws configure command.

Step 2: Craft Your Event JSON
Create a JSON file with the structure of the event you want to put manually. Save it as event.json. For example:

json
Copy code
[
    {
        "Source": "com.mycompany.myapp",
        "DetailType": "Manual Trigger",
        "Detail": "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}",
        "Resources": [
            "resource1",
            "resource2"
        ],
        "Time": "2023-09-08T12:34:56Z"
    }
]
In the "Detail" field, you can put a JSON formatted string containing the specific details of the event.

Step 3: Use the put-events Command
Use the put-events command to manually put the event. You'll need to specify the name of your EventBridge event bus and the file containing your event JSON. The default event bus name is default. Here's how you can do this:

sh
Copy code
aws events put-events --entries file://event.json
